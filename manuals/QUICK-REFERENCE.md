## ⚖️ Double-Entry Basics

**Every transaction has TWO sides**:

### Donation Example
```
Debit:  Cash (Asset increases)         $100
Credit: Income (Revenue increases)     $100
```

### Expense Example
```
Debit:  Expense (Expense increases)    $100
Credit: Cash (Asset decreases)         $100
```

### Fund Transfer Example
```
Debit:  Cash/Building Fund (increases)  $100
Credit: Cash/General Fund (decreases)   $100
```

**Rule**: Debits always equal Credits!
