## Fund Balances Explained

### What Are Fund Balances?

Fund balances show how your net assets are designated:

**Unrestricted Funds**:
- Can be used for any purpose
- Board has full discretion
- Example: General Fund

**Temporarily Restricted Funds**:
- Donor-designated for specific purpose
- Must be used as designated
- Examples: Building Fund, Mission Fund

**Permanently Restricted Funds** (rare):
- Principal must be maintained
- Only earnings can be spent
- Example: Endowment Fund

### Reading Fund Cards

Each card shows:
- **Fund Name**: e.g., "General Fund"
- **Balance**: Total designated to this fund
- **Status**: (Unrestricted) or (Restricted)

**Important**: Fund cards add up to Total Net Assets!

## Common Questions

### Q: Why are fund balances different from bank account balances?
**A**: 
- **Bank accounts** (Assets) = Physical money location
- **Funds** (Equity) = Purpose designation
- One checking account can hold multiple funds

**Example**:
- Checking account: $50,000
- But that $50,000 includes:
  - $30,000 General Fund
  - $15,000 Building Fund
  - $5,000 Mission Fund

### Q: Should Total Assets equal Total Net Assets?
**A**: Only if you have zero liabilities. Formula:
```
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Net Assets
```

### Q: What if Net Assets is negative?
**A**: You owe more than you own. Serious financial trouble. Immediate action needed.

### Q: Why is a Fund showing negative?
**A**: You spent more from that fund than it had. Either:
- Error in recording (check transactions)
- Need to transfer from another fund
- Temporarily overspent (move money back)

### Q: Do voided transactions appear?
**A**: No, voided transactions are automatically excluded.

### Q: Can I see previous months?
**A**: Yes! Change the "As of Date" to any past date.

### Q: Why doesn't this match my bank statement?
**A**: Balance Sheet includes ALL assets (checking, savings, equipment, etc.), not just checking. Plus accounts payable and other items.
