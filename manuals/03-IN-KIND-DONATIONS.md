- Equipment (riding mower, computers, furniture)
- Supplies (office supplies, food, materials)

- Property (land, buildings - requires special handling)

**Important IRS Rules:**

## Accounting Logic

### Fixed Asset In-Kind Donation
```
Example: $3,500 riding mower donated

Journal Entry:
- Debit: 1400 - Equipment (Asset increases)
- Credit: 4050 - Non-Cash Contributions (Income increases)

Result: 
- Asset goes on Balance Sheet
- Income recognized on Income Statement
- NO cash involved
```

### Donated Supply In-Kind Donation
```
Example: $250 office supplies donated

Journal Entry:
- Debit: 5400 - Office Expenses (Expense increases)
- Credit: 4050 - Non-Cash Contributions (Income increases)

Result:
- Expense and Income both increase
- Net Income unchanged (expense = income)
- NO cash involved
```

- Shows date and description
- NO dollar amount shown on statement
- Blue badge marks as "In-Kind"

**IRS Disclaimer Included:**
- Donor responsible for determining value
- Church provides acknowledgment only
- Church does not assign valuation
- Donor responsible for documentation

## Common Questions

### Q: Can the church tell the donor what their donation is worth?
**A**: NO. The church cannot and should not assign a value. This is the donor's responsibility.

### Q: What if the donor asks us to value their donation?
**A**: Politely explain:
- IRS rules prohibit us from assigning value
- Donor must determine fair market value
- Donor should consult tax professional
- Items over $5,000 may need professional appraisal

### Q: Do we record services as in-kind donations?
**A**: Generally, no. Volunteer services are not tax-deductible to the donor, so there's no need to track them as in-kind donations. However, if a professional provides services at no charge that would normally be billed, this could be recorded.

### Q: What if the item is clearly not worth what the donor says?
**A**: Record what the donor states, but:
- You can suggest they consult a tax professional
- You are not required to challenge their valuation
- Your responsibility is only acknowledgment

### Q: Should we record small in-kind donations (under $25)?
**A**: It's up to your church policy. Many churches have a minimum threshold ($25 or $50) for recording in-kind donations to reduce administrative work.

### Q: What if someone donates an old car?
**A**: Special rules apply:
- Vehicles require IRS Form 1098-C
- Church must file with IRS within 30 days
- Consult with your accountant for proper handling
- May require separate process

## Tips and Best Practices

### Recording Guidelines
✅ **Require donor information** - IRS compliance  
✅ **Get detailed descriptions** - Be specific  
✅ **Document condition** - Note if used, new, etc.  
✅ **Take photos** - For valuable items  
✅ **Issue receipts promptly** - Within 30 days

### Valuation Guidance
📋 Refer donors to IRS Publication 561 (Determining Value)  
📋 Suggest comparable sales (eBay, Craigslist)  
📋 Recommend professional appraisal for high-value items  
📋 Never provide valuation yourself

### When to Decline
⚠️ Broken or damaged items with no value  
⚠️ Items that create liability (unsafe equipment)  
⚠️ Items you can't use or store  
⚠️ Items requiring expensive disposal
