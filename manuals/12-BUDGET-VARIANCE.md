## Common Questions

### Q: What if we haven't set up budgets?

- Consistent patterns over multiple months

### Q: What causes variances?
**A**: Common reasons:

## Using Budget Variance Effectively

### Monthly Review Process

**Step 1: Run the Report**
- First week of new month
- Last month's actuals vs budget

**Step 2: Identify Significant Variances**
- Income ±10% or more
- Expenses ±10% or more
- Large dollar amounts (±$500+)

**Step 3: Investigate Causes**
For each significant variance:
- Why did it happen?
- One-time or recurring?
- Can we control it?
- Do we need action?

**Step 4: Take Action**
- Unfavorable income: Plan giving campaign
- Unfavorable expense: Reduce spending
- Update forecast if needed
- Adjust budget if unrealistic

**Step 5: Document**
- Note reasons for variances
- Record actions taken
- Share with board if significant

## Tips and Best Practices

### Monthly Routine
✅ **Run report first week** - Last month's data  
✅ **Focus on big items** - >10% or >$500  
✅ **Investigate each** - Know the reason  
✅ **Document findings** - For future reference  
✅ **Share with leadership** - Transparency

### Red Flags
🚨 **Income consistently under** - Giving problem  
🚨 **Expenses consistently over** - Control problem  
🚨 **Same accounts always off** - Bad budget  
🚨 **Growing variances** - Losing control  
🚨 **Deficit trending** - Financial crisis

### When to Adjust Budget

**Mid-Year Adjustment OK if**:
- Major change in circumstances
- Original budget clearly unrealistic
- Consistent pattern of variance
- Board approval obtained

**Don't Adjust if**:
- Temporary variance
- One-time event
- Can be corrected
- Still early in year

### Communication Tips

**To Board**:
- Focus on summary and top issues
- Explain causes clearly
- Present actions taken
- Keep positive tone where appropriate

**To Staff**:
- Share relevant department budgets
- Explain overage impacts
- Request spending control if needed
- Encourage cost-consciousness

## Troubleshooting

### No Budget Data Showing
**Problem**: All budget columns show $0  
**Cause**: Budgets not set up  
**Solution**: Contact Admin to enter budgets

### Percentages Show "N/A"
**Problem**: Can't calculate percentage  
**Cause**: Budget for that account is $0  
**Solution**: Normal if account not budgeted

### Variance Doesn't Match Calculation
**Problem**: Numbers don't add up  
**Cause**: System error or rounding  
**Solution**: Refresh page, recalculate manually

### Can't Filter by Fund
**Problem**: Fund filter not working  
**Solution**: Verify budgets entered per fund
